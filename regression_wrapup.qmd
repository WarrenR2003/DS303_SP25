# Assignment 2: Wrapping up linear and logistic regression\*

Assignment 2 covers linear and logistic regression models and includes many of the topics we have covered over the entire semester. You will be using `palmerpenguins` data, which includes a nice variety of continuous and categorical predictors.

To submit this assignment, render this file and save as a pdf. Upload the pdf to Canvas.

\*This assignment does not include mixed effects models, but you will be seeing that on another assignment.

## Load Packages

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(lme4)
library(tidyverse)
# install.packages("palmerpenguins") # install if needed
library(palmerpenguins)
```

## Load Data

Load the `penguins` data and examine it below (use `summary()`, etc.)

```{r}
penguins <- penguins


```

## Question 1: Describe the data

What data is contained in this data set? Describe at least four variables (excluding `year`), including what they represent and their data type. Lastly, describe whether you think `year` would be a useful predictor in this data.

(Write answer here)

## Question 2: EDA

Explore your data visually. Create at least two visualizations that show the relationship between `flipper_length_mm` and its potential predictors.

```{r, warning = FALSE}


```

## Question 3: Apply a linear regression

Fit a simple linear regression model predicting `flipper_length_mm` from `body_mass_g`. Interpret the slope and intercept.

```{r}


```

Interpret your model output in your own words below. Be sure to include a sentence explaining how `body_mass_g` impacts `flipper_length_mm` and whether or not the effect is significant.

**Answer:** (Write answer here)

## Question 4: Apply a multiple linear regression

Fit a linear regression model predicting `flipper_length_mm` from both `body_mass_g` and `bill_length_mm`. Interpret the slopes and intercept.

```{r}


```

Similar to Question 3, interpret the model output in your own words here:

**Answer:** (Write answer here)

## Question 5: Include an interaction

Fit a simple linear regression model predicting `flipper_length_mm` from `body_mass_g,` `bill_length_mm`, and the interaction of the two. Interpret the slopes and intercept.

```{r}


```

Interpret the model output in your own words below. If there was a change in the pattern of significance, try to explain the logic below as well.

**Answer:** (Write answer here)

## Question 6: Compare models

Compare the models you built in Questions 4 and 5 using `anova()`.

```{r}


```

-   Which is the better model? How do you know?

    -   **Answer:** (Write answer here)

-   Is it possible to compare the models from Questions 3 and 5 using the same method? Why or why not?

    -   **Answer:** (Write answer here)

## Question 7: Categorical predictors

Build a linear model that includes a categorical predictor of your choice. It is fine to stick with dummy coding. Optional: apply a different coding scheme AND interpret the output correctly for +1 extra credit.

```{r}


```

-   What is the reference level of your categorical predictor?

    -   **Answer:**

-   What is your interpretation of this model output? Address all coefficients.

    -   **Answer:**

## Question 8: Relevel your categorical variable

Relevel your categorical variable so that a **different** level becomes the reference. Then, run the same model you did in Question 7 and interpret the output.

Relevel:

```{r}


```

Apply model from Question 7:

```{r}


```

-   What is the new reference level of your categorical predictor?

    -   **Answer:**

-   What is your interpretation of this new model output? Address all coefficients.

    -   **Answer:**

## Question 9: Apply a logistic regression

Apply a logistic regression. Include as many predictor variables as you'd like. Remember that your predicted outcome variable needs to be binary (or categorical with two levels).

\
Hint: You could use `sex` or create a binary variable of your own (e.g., Gentoo vs. non-Gentoo) to test your model.

```{r}

```

What are your key takeaways from this model?

**Answer:** (Write answer here)

## Question 10: Synthesize the information

Imagine you’re a biologist studying penguin populations. Which predictors do you think are most important to measure or record in the field to predict flipper length? Why?

**Answer:** (Write answer here)

## Bonus: Stepwise Regression

Perform stepwise regression to find the best model for an outcome of your choice. You will likely encounter an error – fixing that error and explaining your findings will earn you +1 extra credit. Show your work.

```{r}


```

According to this stepwise regression, explain how the final model was selected.
